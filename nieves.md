In this article, Nieves aims to identify which variables most greatly effect the human population distribution across low and middle income countries. He utilizes a Random Forest Model which works by first establishing the covariates that will be included in the model. Following this, census data is used to in order to create a data layer that includes the population density in a variety of locations. This information is then put into individual grid cells. The random forest model works by gathering data from a variety of locations. There are a number of trees that are located in various positions which allows for as much data as possible, allowing for a more accurate estimate of population distribution. 

The data showed that different factors regarding topography were the most important predictors of how population density was spread thorughout the 32 countries. Some of these factors include built enviornmental and urban/suburban settlements, as well as climate. The dasymmetric population allocation works by seperating a large area into multiple parts, and then looking into census data and adding other layers of various covariates to these datasets.
