In this article, Nieves aims to answer the question of which variables most greatly effect the human population distribution across low and middle income countries. The random forest model works by using a variety of census data found from different sources in order to a population density weighing layer. Then adding on data to census blocks that are in grid cells using another layer of population density. The data showed that different factors regarding topography were the most important predictors of how population density was spread thorughout the 32 countries. The dasymmetric population allocation works by using specific information such as land topography, and by splitting this area up into multiple parts that are then adding data on top of these census blocks.
