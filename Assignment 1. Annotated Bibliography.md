1. Peak, C. M., Wesolowski, A., Erbach-Schoenberg, E. Z., Tatem, A. J., Wetter, E., Lu, X., … Bengtsson, L. (2018). Population mobility reductions associated with travel restrictions during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone: use of mobile phone data. *International Journal of Epidemiology*, *47*(5), 1562–1570. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyy095

   In the article “Population Mobility Reductions Associated with Travel Restrictions during the Ebola Epidemic in Sierra Leone: Use of Mobile Phone Data,” the authors expand on ‘big data’ approaches including the use of CRD’s and cell phone usage to track how the citizens of Sierra Leone travel during the during the Ebola outbreak. In March of 2015, a travel restriction was placed on Sierra Leone, in which citizens were asked to stay at home, in an attempt to eradicate the Ebola virus. Since many citizens in Sierra Leone have access to mobile devices, researchers were able to utilize ‘call detail records (CRD’s)’ in order to track the movement of the citizens of Sierra Leone, and in turn tracking the transmission of the disease and its movement patterns. In his book “Development as Freedom,” Amartya Sen expands on his definition of human development which he defines as increasing the freedoms and choices of humans. Sen touches on some of the main types of freedoms which include political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. The article can be tied back to Sen’s definitions of social opportunities and protective security. In Sen’s book, he explains that social opportunities describe the “arrangements that society makes for education, health care and so on”. Protective security is needed to provide a social safety net for preventing the affected population from being reduced to abject misery, and in some cases even starvation and death. In this studies case, the citizens are trying to be protected from death by the government attempting the contain and eradicate the Ebola virus.  

   The authors address the dimension of human development related to a long and healthy life, which is measured by life expectancy. The sustainable development goal focused on was “good health and well-being, which was emphasized by attempting to increase life expectancy by eradicating the Ebola outbreak all together. The researchers used datasets from global positioning systems and short message services to track the movement of citizens. 

   The researchers are investigating migration patterns of the citizens in Sierra Leone in order to see how many citizens migrate following a travel ban in order to eradicate the Ebola virus. The researchers are working to investigate how migration patterns change (using cell phone data) after a travel ban has been put on the country.
