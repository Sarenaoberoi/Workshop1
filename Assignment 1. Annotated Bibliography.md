## Problem Statement

   The Ebola virus is an extremely dangerous disease that targets the organs, the immune system, and causes excessive bleeding. Since the Ebola virus targets so many specific parts of the body (including white blood cells), the disease is extremely fatal with no guaranteed treatment. Although scientists are researching various treatment plans and cures, the fatality rate is currently very high. Many countries around the world including parts of West Africa such as Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Libera, have seen a significant number of deaths due to the threatening virus. During the time of the epidemic, there was a dramatic decline in the economies of the countries affected. Trading and tourism were also greatly affected which directly resulted in a large regression of the economy. Furthermore, peoples freedoms were being restricted, as citizens were unable to go about their everyday lives including going to their jobs. It is important to address the epidemic in order to see economic success and make the citizens feel safe in their home countries once again. 
In America, medical technologies are extremely advanced and there are a great deal of sophisticated infection control policies. Unfortunately, the quality of life and medical technologies are not as refined in Western Africa which makes the disease more transmissible. Those with a stronger immune system typically have a better chance of survival, but this is unlikely in select countries in Africa. It is possible to utilize data science methods in order to track the spread of the disease. By using different techniques and measures such as call detail records, geospatial data, and modeling the data using diverse models such as the ‘Poisson Model’, it is possible to not only know and where the disease is spreading, but why it is spreading. By keeping a close eye and surveillance measures on countries that are still at risk for the Ebola virus, we can contain the virus all together and keep it from becoming an issue once again (World Health Organization, 2020).

In 2014, the Ebola virus was extremely prevalent in distinct countries in Western Africa. The Ebola virus is a disease that is easily spread and is even more common in highly dense areas. Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with a number of body fluids including the blood and vomit of an infected person. Some of the main symptoms of the disease include excessive vomiting and bleeding, diarrhea, and rashes. There have been studies done regarding an extremely effective vaccine used for the virus, but the vaccine was not introduced to many African countries until after the large outbreak. Although there is currently no single treatment for curing the Ebola virus, there are additional methods used to prevent the disease from being fatal. Some of these procedures include blood transfusions and drug therapies. Following the massive outbreak of Ebola cases in Western Africa, the government decided to take large preventive measures in order to prevent such a large tragedy from occurring again. Research has shown that one of the main transmission methods of Ebola is through direct contact with the meat of animals including bats and apes. It is extremely important that individuals dealing with these animals ensure that they are not directly touching the infected meat. Furthermore, it is important that individuals refrain from contact with those individuals that are infected by the virus. By ensuring that individuals are thoroughly washing their hands, especially after coming in contact with someone infected, it will be easier to prevent the transmission of the disease. In order to make the distribution of Ebola cases more accessible to the public, there have been a variety of maps created that plot points that show how many cases of Ebola there have been, along with which the species of the virus. One map in specific, shows this information from the year 1976 to the present day. These maps are created by counting the number of cases seen in each country, and then using either a Poisson model or a binomial random variable linear model to map the information.

Population mobility reductions associated with travel restrictions during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone: use of mobile phone data. International Journal of Epidemiology, 47(5), 1562–1570. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyy095
In the article “Population Mobility Reductions Associated with Travel Restrictions during the Ebola Epidemic in Sierra Leone: Use of Mobile Phone Data,” the authors expand on ‘big data’ approaches including the use of CDR’s and cell phone usage to track how the citizens of Sierra Leone travel during the Ebola outbreak. In March of 2015, a travel restriction was placed on Sierra Leone, in which citizens were asked to stay at home, in an attempt to eradicate the Ebola virus. Since many citizens in Sierra Leone have access to mobile devices, researchers were able to utilize ‘call detail records (CDR’s) in order to track the movement of the citizens of Sierra Leone, and in turn, track the transmission of the disease and its movement patterns. In his book “Development as Freedom,” Amartya Sen expands on his definition of human development which he defines as increasing the freedoms and choices of humans. Sen touches on some of the main types of freedoms which include political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. The article can be tied back to Sen’s definitions of social opportunities and protective security. In Sen’s book, he explains that social opportunities describe the arrangements that society makes for education and health care, as well as other aspects. Protective security is needed in order to provide a social safety net in order to prevent the citizens of a country from being affected by diseases, misery, and even starvation or death. In this article, the government protects the citizens from death by attempting to contain and eradicate the Ebola virus. The government in Sierra Leone along with other countries has taken a number of preventative measures (such as travel bans) in order to contain the spread of the disease. Along with this, Sen elucidates the idea of increasing each individuals quality of life. Those living with the Ebola virus have limited opportunities and capabilities and are restricted from living the best life they can live. When Sen discusses the quality of life, he also touches on life expectancy in regards to development and freedom, as life expectancy is crucial in our understanding of development. 
The dimension of human development that the authors touch on is a long and healthy life, which is measured by life expectancy. The sustainable development goal focused on was ‘good health and well-being,’ which was emphasized by attempting to increase life expectancy by eradicating the Ebola outbreak all together. The researchers looked into global positioning systems and call detail records (along with cell towers) to track the movement of citizens. These CDR’s had information regarding the exact location the call was made. This makes the movement and location of citizens more accessible. The radiation model (grounded on phone data) was a method used in order to track the flows of people between different locations. This model works by calculating the configurations of movement based on past patterns. The researchers main goal was to investigate migration patterns of the citizens in Sierra Leone in order to see how many citizens migrate following a travel ban, in order to eradicate the Ebola virus. In sum, the researchers are investigating how migration patterns change (using cell phone data) after a travel ban has been put on the country.

Following the initial outbreak of the Ebola virus, researchers looked into specific outbreaks in Western African including Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. They wanted to understand if there was a relationship between the Ebola virus and environmental and socio-demographic variables. Researchers looked into a variety of covariates including average rainfall, average elevation, households without toilets households with drinking water, and households with radios, and compared these findings to the number of total confirmed Ebola outbreaks. Research showed that the greatest number of confirmed Ebola cases were seen with Therefore, those without a radio were unable to receive this vital information. In order to obtain these calculations, the total number of Ebola cases for each covariate, as well as the total population was recorded and placed into a Poisson model. The data was explained using a spatial autoregressive modelling approach that compared the results seen form the spatial and non-spatial variation by each covariate. 
One of the most surprising findings included that ownership of a radio was a strong predictor of whether or not the individual would get the Ebola virus. This is because information regarding the spread of the virus and information about prevention was disseminated using radio campaigns. Another surprising discovery showed that those living in less dense areas regarding population were more prone to the Ebola virus because the hospitals and medical care is not as advanced in these less populated areas. By knowing how different covariates effect the prevalence of Ebola, individuals can look at data to see how to decrease the prevalence of the disease. Amartya Sen speaks a great deal regarding how development is based on the freedoms individual people have. Amartya Sen touches on social opportunities which include __using poisson model – data science method and geospatial !!—how does it effect the disease

By utilizing present day data methods, researchers are able to visualize exactly where the Ebola virus will spread throughout the world. By looking into a number of various aspects such as social media streams, travel sites, and online news stories, different disease-tracking websites such as ‘HealthMap,’ are able to combine data from these sources in order to obtain a more accurate view on how, when, and where the virus is spreading. HealthMap works by aggregating many sources to plot points on a world map that give in depth information about different diseases and their outbreaks around the world. Global air transportation has been looked into as well, in order to see how the movement of those infected with Ebola is moving from country to country. By creating a model that not only displays the distance between two countries, but also other factors such as the frequency of air traffic and the number of passengers between airports in different countries, it is possible to see how probable it is that the Ebola virus enters the country. The ideas discussed above relate to Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, in that the researchers are doing their jobs in order to enlarge the freedoms of the people and prevent them from getting sick and lowering their life expectancy. Furthermore, Sen speaks on the importance of enlarging freedoms as well as expanding opportunities and this could not be done with the Ebola virus spreading rapidly. Therefore, Sen would support the researchers methods of keeping citizens safe and containing the extremely dangerous and fatal Ebola virus. The main dimension of human development being studied was life expectancy, as all of the precautions being taken were to ensure that individuals were able to experience a longer life expectancy by eradicating the Ebola virus, as well as guaranteeing that it not spread around the world.

The Ebola epidemic in 2014 was one with the highest fatality rate, with more than 28,000 reported cases. With the disease being so prevalent around the world, researchers took it upon themselves to see which animal carriers were spreading the disease the most rapidly. After extensive research, it was found that Filovirus-infected bats, along with differences in the environment, were interconnected to the massive outbreak of the virus. The researchers wanted to see the correlation between the environment and the number of infected bats observed. A geographical map was created that displayed the distribution of four different kinds of infected bats. In order to display to relationship between environmental characteristics and the presence of bats, a few regression models were used: MLN (multi-linear model), a GLC (generalized multi-linear model), and GPC (polynomial model). The data regarding the environmental characteristics was obtained using the ‘Google Earth Engine database collection.’ A few of the environmental characteristics being tested were precipitation, daily air temperature, and land cover index. A very important result observed from conducting the study showed that a greater number of infected bats were found were land vegetation was the highest. All of the data regarding the land was obtained using satellite imagery but was soon converted into various indexes (depending on which variable used).
