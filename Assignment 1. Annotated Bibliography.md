## Problem Statement

   The Ebola virus is an extremely dangerous disease that targets the organs, the immune system, and causes excessive bleeding. Since the Ebola virus targets so many specific parts of the body (including white blood cells), the disease is extremely fatal with no guaranteed treatment. Although scientists are researching various treatment plans and cures, the fatality rate is currently very high. Many countries around the world including parts of West Africa such as Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Libera, have seen a significant number of deaths due to the threatening virus. During the time of the epidemic, there was a dramatic decline in the economies of the countries affected. Trading and tourism were also greatly affected which directly resulted in a large regression of the economy. Furthermore, peoples freedoms were being restricted, as citizens were unable to go about their everyday lives including going to their jobs. It is important to address the epidemic in order to see economic success and make the citizens feel safe in their home countries once again. 
In America, medical technologies are extremely advanced and there are a great deal of sophisticated infection control policies. Unfortunately, the quality of life and medical technologies are not as refined in Western Africa which makes the disease more transmissible. Those with a stronger immune system typically have a better chance of survival, but this is unlikely in select countries in Africa. It is possible to utilize data science methods in order to track the spread of the disease. By using different techniques and measures such as call detail records, geospatial data, and modeling the data using diverse models such as the ‘Poisson Model’, it is possible to not only know and where the disease is spreading, but why it is spreading. By keeping a close eye and surveillance measures on countries that are still at risk for the Ebola virus, we can contain the virus all together and keep it from becoming an issue once again (World Health Organization, 2020).

In 2014, the Ebola virus was extremely prevalent in distinct countries in West Africa. The Ebola virus is a disease that is easily spread and is even more common in highly dense areas. Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with a number of body fluids including the blood and vomit of an infected person. Some of the main symptoms of the disease include excessive vomiting and bleeding, diarrhea, and rashes. There have been studies done regarding an extremely effective vaccine used for the virus, but the vaccine was not introduced to many African countries until after the large outbreak. Although there is currently no single treatment for curing the Ebola virus, there are additional methods used to prevent the disease from being fatal. Some of these procedures include blood transfusions and drug therapies. Following the massive outbreak of Ebola cases in Western Africa, the government decided to take large preventive measures in order to prevent such a large tragedy from occurring again. Research has shown that one of the main transmission methods of Ebola is through direct contact with the meat of animals including bats and apes. It is extremely important that individuals dealing with these animals ensure that they are not directly touching the infected meat. Furthermore, it is important that individuals refrain from contact with those individuals that are infected by the virus. By ensuring that individuals are thoroughly washing their hands, especially after coming in contact with someone infected, it will be easier to prevent the transmission of the disease. In order to make the distribution of Ebola cases more accessible to the public, there have been a variety of maps created that plot points that show how many cases of Ebola there have been, along with which specific species of the virus. One map in specific, shows this information from the year 1976 to the present day. The map shows different colored and sized circles with each color representing a type of species and the size representing how many cases. These circles are spread around the map to show the distribution of Ebola cases (with species and number) around the world. These maps are created by counting the number of cases seen in each country, and then using either a Poisson model or a binomial random variable linear model to map the information.

Population mobility reductions associated with travel restrictions during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone: use of mobile phone data. International Journal of Epidemiology, 47(5), 1562–1570. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyy095

   In the article “Population Mobility Reductions Associated with Travel Restrictions during the Ebola Epidemic in Sierra Leone: Use of Mobile Phone Data,” the authors expand on ‘big data’ approaches including the use of CDR’s and cell phone usage to track how the citizens of Sierra Leone travel during the Ebola outbreak. In March of 2015, a travel restriction was placed on Sierra Leone, in which citizens were asked to stay at home, in an attempt to eradicate the Ebola virus. Since many citizens in Sierra Leone have access to mobile devices, researchers were able to utilize ‘call detail records’ (CDR’s) in order to track the movement of the citizens of Sierra Leone, and in turn, track the transmission of the disease and its movement patterns. In his book “Development as Freedom,” Amartya Sen expands on his definition of human development which he defines as increasing the freedoms and choices of humans. Sen touches on some of the main types of freedoms which include social opportunities, protective security, political freedoms, economic facilities, and transparency guarantees. The article can be tied back to Sen’s definitions of social opportunities and protective security. In Sen’s book, he explains that social opportunities are integral in increasing the well-being of an individual, as well as their opportunity to live happily, by allowing them to receive an education and have access to health care. With the Ebola virus being so prevalent, individuals were deprived of this right, which also directly resulted in a decrease in well-being and the opportunity to live a happy life. Sen also touches on protective security which he describes as “a social safety net” in which the citizens are protected from disease, starvation, and death. In this article, the government protects the citizens from death by attempting to contain and eradicate the Ebola virus. The government in Sierra Leone along with other countries has taken a number of preventative measures (such as travel bans) in order to contain the spread of the disease. Along with this, Sen elucidates the idea of increasing each individuals quality of life. Those living with the Ebola virus have limited opportunities and capabilities and are restricted from living the best life they can live. When Sen discusses the quality of life, he also touches on life expectancy in regards to development and freedom, as a longer life expectancy is crucial in our understanding of development. 

The dimension of human development that the authors emphasize is a long and healthy life. A long and health life is based on the life expectancy of each individual. After the Ebola virus became prevalent, life expectancy decreased dramatically. The sustainable development goal focused on was healthy lives and well-being which was emphasized by attempting to increase life expectancy by eradicating the Ebola outbreak all together. The researchers looked into global positioning systems and call detail records (along with cell towers) to track the movement of citizens. These CDR’s had information regarding the exact location the call was made. This makes the movement and location of citizens more accessible. The radiation model (grounded on phone data) was a method used in order to track and model the movements of individuals from various locations. This model works by calculating the configurations of movement based on past patterns. The researchers main goal was to investigate migration patterns of the citizens in Sierra Leone in order to see how many citizens migrate following a travel ban, in order to eradicate the Ebola virus. In sum, the researchers are investigating how migration patterns change (using cell phone data) after a travel ban has been put on the country.
