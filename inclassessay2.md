In Class Essay 2

In his book Scale, Geoff West touches on a number of aspects regarding the expanding nature of cities. He explains that cities are not only the “hubs of innovation,” but also have a negative side that involves crime, pollution, poverty, corruption, etc. This idea of a dark side in cities around the world can be portrayed by the City of God, in Rio de Janeiro. In the movie (Cidade de Deus), the City of God is represented as an active and dynamic city in which there are a number of different group including gangs, drug dealers, groovies, etc). The habitants of the City of God are not only used to daily police raids, but also shoot outs that occur more often than anyone would believe. Within this dynamic city, there are a number of different social interactions that make up the framework of the city as a whole. 
Firstly, there are a number of gangs that run the city. The gang on top is run by Lil dice, who rules through fear and violence. Although he has enough to live a high quality life, his greed keeps him looking to expand his reach. This is an idea presented in West’s book, in which he explains that businesses and individuals living in society today, are run by this overlying sense of greed. Although individuals may have everything they need, they push to expand their business even more in order to see an increase in revenue and income. In the City of God, through a great deal of violence, Lil dice aims to run all of the drug business in the city. The citizens living in the City of God are almost desensitized to the commonly occurring police raids, but they rarely effect Lil Dice, as he is able to bribe the officers into letting him stay in power. Lil Dice’s right hand man, Benny, is a polar opposite of Lil Dice, in that he is friendly, caring, and good-natured. Benny is full of compassion and rarely uses violence to get what he wants. In the middle of the movie, Benny falls in love and decides the gang life is not how he wants to live the rest of his life. He attempts to leave with his girlfriend and move to a farm to live a simple life. However, a man that attempts to kill Lil Dice, mistakenly shoots and kills Benny. Just like that, Benny’s dreams of leaving his old life are crushed. All Benny wanted was to escape his old life full of danger, violence, and corruption, but was killed before he had the chance. In the beginning of the movie we also see Shaggy (member of the Tender Trio) try to leave, but he is killed as well. Even after Benny’s death Lil Dice continues to use violence to take over other drug businesses, with his main goal being to gain control over Carrot’s drug business. 
Rocket, a teenager living in the City of God, did not want to be involved in any of the gang violence or drug dealing, but instead wanted to pursue his dreams of becoming a photographer. He got a job at a newspaper business outside of the city and greatly enjoyed his time there learning how to be a better photographer.
	West expands on a topic known as “Six degrees of separation,” in which he explains that any two people are connected by an average number of only 6 links. This concept is very prevalent in the City of God, in which there were connections between all of the different groups. One connection we see, is Rocket’s brother Goose, who is killed by Lil Dice. Furthermore, once the two main gangs have been established (Lil Dice’s gang and Carrot and Knockout Ned’s Gang), we notice that a number of common people living in the city come to each gang asking for revenge after a run-in with an individual from the other gang. This also supports the six degrees of separation, in that there were a number of connections between everyone living in the city. Furthermore, the number of links between individuals increased at a rapid rate, after the two main gangs were established. West’s book, he explains the concept of super-linearity, which he describes by explaining that social connectivity (as well as socioeconomic quantities) are on a super-linear scale with population size. As the population and size of a city increase, the pace of life also increases as a rapid rate. Furthermore, Socioeconomic quantities are directly dependent on the number of interactions between individuals in a location. This concept was portrayed in the City of God, in that with such a large population size, there was so much going on in the city that individuals did not have the ability to pay attention to every stimuli. This is why it seemed that the citizens were almost desensitized to the violence seen around the city. West also explains the concept of sub-linearity, which is describes by giving an example regarding gas stations and infrastructure seen in cities. He explains that infrastructure is on a sublinear scale with population size: the larger a city is, the fewer number of gas stations are needed. The City of God had a very large population, and the infrastructure seen in the city accurately portrayed this idea of sub-linearity. Locations were always extremely crowded, including the bars. 
	Following the long stretch of violence and gang-related activities, I believe that the City of God saw more urbanization and less corruption. With the police being more aware of the activities seen around the city, and shutting down the violence and drug related actions, it is possible for the City of God to leave its past of corruption, bribery, and violence, and enter a new era of urbanization and knowledge. 

In the City of God, I saw a number of individuals trying to leave their old life filled with gang violence and drug dealing behind, but they were not always successful. When Benny and Shaggy tried to escape they were killed. However, Rocket was able to leave and become a successful photographer. I believe that Rockets view on life and his future explained that your past does not define you. Although growing up in a city riddled with poverty and violence can make it quite difficult to find a new life of your own, it is important that you try to escape this lifestyle and create a successful life for yourself. At the end of the movie, Lil dice is shot and killed by the "Runts" (a group of children that are interested in the gang life and drug dealing). 
Many of the individuals in the movie grew up in a family where all the knew was gangs and drugs. However, by keeping a sense of compassion and empathy towards others, and not letting their dreams leave their minds it is possible to have a bright future. Where you grow up does not define you, but only makes you stronger and more hard-headed in pursuing your dreams. This idea was seen in Rocket, in which he shattered the glass of the old stereotype which stated that it was impossible to escape the beast and change your fate. Without resorting to violence, he was able to leave his past and start a successful life as a photographer.
